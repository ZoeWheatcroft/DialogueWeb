# DialogueWeb
These are the Unity files for an ongoing project focused on creating a dialogue web rather than tree. The purpose of this is to create a reactive AI that feels complex and provide an interesting narrative design to enjoy. 

The program works to create the web with a text file. The text file contains everything the AI will say in response to a context as well as everything the player can react with. The program parses that file and creates connections based on it (context->ai reaction->player reaction->context). The structure relies on dictionaties and arrays and I added a very basic UI.
